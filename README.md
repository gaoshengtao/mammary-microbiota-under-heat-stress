Mammary microbiota under heat stress 🐄🔥🧫

Multi-omics and in vitro validation of heat stress–associated mammary inflammation in dairy cows

To elucidate the mechanisms underlying heat stress–induced mammary inflammation in dairy cows, we integrated proteomic analysis of blood from the mammary vein, time-series metagenomic analysis of milk samples, and in vitro co-culture of mammary epithelial cells and microorganisms.

Overview

This repository provides analysis scripts and workflows used to investigate host–microbiota interactions in the bovine mammary gland under heat stress conditions. The study combines:

• Proteomics of mammary-vein blood  

• Time-series milk metagenomics

• Mammary epithelial cell RNA-seq

• In vitro co-culture experiments with live or heat-killed microorganisms

Highlights

• Time-series milk metagenomics workflow  

  QC → host depletion → taxonomic profiling

• Transcriptomics workflow (RNA-seq)  

  QC / trimming → quantification (kallisto) and/or alignment-based analysis

• Figure-ready R scripts  

  For reproducible visualization and manuscript-quality figures

• Shell-first, HPC-friendly design  

  Easy to run with nohup, sbatch, or GNU parallel

Repository contents

Key scripts included in this repository:

• trimmomatic.sh — Read trimming and quality control (short reads)

• hostfree_bowtie.sh — Host read removal using Bowtie2

• metaphlan-rawdata.sh — MetaPhlAn taxonomic profiling

• run_RNAseq.sh — RNA-seq processing pipeline (wrapper)

• run_kallisto.sh — RNA-seq quantification using kallisto

• codes for Figure plot.R — R scripts for plotting and visualization

Tip  

If you later add directories such as data/, results/, or figures/, this README will remain valid; only file paths in the examples need to be updated.

Software requirements

The workflows were designed for Linux / HPC environments.

Required tools

• Trimmomatic  

  Adapter removal and quality trimming of sequencing reads

• Bowtie2  

  Host read removal by mapping reads to the host reference genome

• MetaPhlAn  

  Taxonomic profiling of host-depleted metagenomic reads

• kallisto  

  Alignment-free quantification of RNA-seq data

• R  

  Downstream analysis and figure generation  
  Required packages include (but are not limited to):
  • tidyverse

  • ggplot2

Reproducibility note

Note  

For full reproducibility, we strongly recommend recording exact software versions.  

This can be achieved by:

> ```bash

conda env export > env.yml

```

> or by using a containerized environment (Docker or Singularity).

Workflow A — Milk metagenomics (time-series)

A1. Quality control and trimming

Trim adapters and low-quality bases using trimmomatic.sh.
bash trimmomatic.sh \
  -1 sample_R1.fastq.gz \
  -2 sample_R2.fastq.gz \
  -o results/01_trimmed/


Expected output

• Cleaned paired-end FASTQ files for downstream profiling

A2. Host read removal (host depletion)

Remove host-derived reads by mapping to the host reference genome.
bash hostfree_bowtie.sh \
  -1 results/01_trimmed/sample.clean.R1.fastq.gz \
  -2 results/01_trimmed/sample.clean.R2.fastq.gz \
  -x /path/to/host_bowtie2_index \
  -o results/02_hostfree/


Expected output

• Host-depleted paired FASTQ files (recommended input for MetaPhlAn)

• Mapping statistics and logs for quality assessment

A3. Taxonomic profiling (MetaPhlAn)

Generate taxonomic profiles using MetaPhlAn.
bash metaphlan-rawdata.sh \
  -i results/02_hostfree/ \
  -o results/03_metaphlan/


Expected output

• Per-sample MetaPhlAn taxonomic tables

• Optional merged abundance tables (depending on script settings)

Workflow B — Mammary epithelial cell RNA-seq (in vitro)

B1. RNA-seq processing

Run the RNA-seq workflow wrapper.
bash run_RNAseq.sh \
  -i rnaseq_fastq/ \
  -o results/rnaseq/


B2. Quantification with kallisto (optional / recommended)

Perform pseudoalignment-based RNA-seq quantification.
bash run_kallisto.sh \
  -i rnaseq_fastq/ \
  -x /path/to/kallisto_index \
  -o results/04_kallisto/


Expected output

• Transcript- or gene-level abundance estimates

• Log files for quality control and troubleshooting

Workflow C — Figures and visualization

Reproduce manuscript-style figures using the R plotting scripts.
Rscript "codes for Figure plot.R"


If the plotting script expects specific input filenames, consider documenting the input table format or adding a small config.R file.

Reproducibility checklist

• Record software versions (conda env export, sessionInfo() in R)

• Maintain a complete sample metadata table (metadata.tsv)

• Save host depletion statistics and sequencing depth summaries

• Generate merged abundance matrices for downstream analyses (alpha/beta diversity, longitudinal modeling)
